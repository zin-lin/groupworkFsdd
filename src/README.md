##Background

Hey Welcome to our game ``` Mingog's Vengence: They live in a society ```, where players can explore
and colonise the `Gog the Galaxy`.

`Mingog`, the aliens from the galaxy of `Gog`. `Mingogs` have lived in this
galaxy for Centuries.  

already. So Yeah, it's nice.

But one day, the Alien civilisations of `Evu` `Lunzar` `Trul` `Sirith` from different galaxies far far away,
visit `Gog`, to plan, invade and conquer, the system. `Mingog` tried to defend their land from the intruders.

The problem, you see, is that these advance civilisations, even with upperhand, have some problems distributing the 
planet in the galaxy, which led out to open conflicts between the `Evu` `Lunzar` `Trul` and `Sirith`.
